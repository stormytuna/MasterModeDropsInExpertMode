Master Mode Drops in Expert Mode is pretty simple, it just allows relics and pets to drop in expert mode. It works with all vanilla bosses and should work with most modded bosses

This mod also has a small config, allowing you to toggle relics and pets separately, making pets have a 100% drop chance and having the tooltips be updated automatically
